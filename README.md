This repository has code related to the Mandelbrot set. The first program makes an interactive plot of the Mandelbrot, where a right click zooms in and a left click zooms out (as centered on the clicked point). The second program generates animated PNGs of zooming into the Mandelbrot set. Both programs cannot zoom beyond 2^(-45).

The animated PNG produced from 'Mandelbrot_animation.py' might not play on all platforms. It can be played through FireFox though, as they have great animated PNG support. It can also be opened with Chrome, but anecdotally that seems to produce choppier animation.
