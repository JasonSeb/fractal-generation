This repository has code related to the Mandelbrot set. The first program makes an interactive plot of the Mandelbrot, where a right click zooms in and a left click zooms out (as centered on the clicked point). The second program generates animated PNGs of zooming into the Mandelbrot set. Both programs cannot zoom beyond 2^(-45).
